# Seniority is Priority – Website for Old Age Home Connectivity
Developed a user-friendly and fully functional website aimed at enhancing the visibility and outreach of old age homes. The platform features multiple sections—Home, About Us, Amenities, Gallery, FAQ, and Contact Us—accessible via a dynamic navigation bar with engaging animations (bounce, pulse, flush). Integrated a backend-connected Query form on the contact page using MongoDB for admin access. The website was officially accepted by **Lion’s Airport City Old Age Home**.

We have used HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and certain animation libraries for frontend
and Node JS, Mongoose, Mongo DB for backend.
